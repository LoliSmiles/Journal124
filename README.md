## Answering questions on dataset

I picked the following question, "Under normal circumstances, does a person who reclines their seat during a flight have any obligation to the person sitting behind them?" because it seemed like the most intresting. I came in thinking most people would agree to be more delicate for others which still to be true but it only makes 63.6 % of the total. While more agree they have an obligation there is still a 36.4% that seem to oppose.
